There's this curious little scene in Bechdel's Fun Home where she encounters a snake while on a trip.
At first glance, the snake might appear to only be there to keep the plot interesting.
But Bechdel has allusions and symbolisms lurking around left and right. She makes formal decisions that help convey her story.
Firstly, how does Bechdel frame her younger self's discovery of the snake?
During this trip, Alison ventures into the forest to get some cans of pop, or soda (I'll refer to her younger self as Alison and her present self as Bechdel, the narrator).
Her walking is slow, with shoulders are hunched forward, eyes are cast down; It creates a tense atmosphere.
When she sees the snake, she runs out of the forest and shouts for help.
Alison is relieved when they don't find the snake, but also embarrassed.
She describes this situation as failing an initiation rite. In what way? There is reason to believe that this "rite" refers to her first time having sex.
Why do I jump there? On the next page, Bechdel acknowledges the use of the snake as a phallus.
Plus, Bill here has quite the questionable pose. (Use your imagination here)
Alison's experience with the snake seems to allude to her attempt at hetero-sex.
This particular snake, the Black Rat Snake, is a harmless and commonly found species in Pennsylvania.
It seems that she didn't like what she saw, hence the relief when it was gone.
But she feels that she falls short of society's expectations and feels embarrassed for being scared of something harmless.
Alison realizes at a young age what she likes and does not like. She feels embarrassed and also wonders about the implications for the future. 
Notice how only she seems to be concerned, while everyone else is unbothered. This is a problem only she is facing.
What else does the snake signify to Alison? 
Not only is the snake a phallus, but there is a feminine aspect to the snake.
In Hopi Native American culture, snakes represent fertility, rebirth 
In Greek Mythology, the snake is associated with Medusa. Medusa was shunned by society, beautiful then ugly.
It is this duality of the snake that Bechdel uses to characterize aspects of her life. It starts popping up everywhere.
Alison's body here is ambiguous. Can we tell if it's the body of a male or female? She juxtaposes it with her brother in the back, whom she looks very similar to.
Here as well.
Bechdel deliberately reinforces this idea of non-duality to convey the uncertainty she possessed about her own identity. She didn't sway one way or the other.
Bechdel also alludes to the snake from Adam + Eve just by using "postlapsarian" (meaning after the fall of mankind, exiled from Eden).
The snake is a temptor, is evil, is the devil himself. 
But look at how innocent it looks here, drinking water... 
What if Bechdel's father had seen a snake? The temptation of the snake led him to express his homosexuality in rather illegal ways (Minor grooming).
Just as Adam and Eve see a snake prior to their exile, her father might have seen a snake, right before he left the world.
It's interesting, as Alison would have seen the snake as she first discovered her sexuality while her father would have seen the snake at his end.
But there's more! Notice the father's book here...
Is that a snake on the cover? That particular formation of a snake with its tail in its mouth is called an Ouroboros.
Look! The title! (Worm in Old English could also mean snake, serpent, or dragon)
Anyways, this book was a fantasy novel written in 16th century English despite being published in 1922.
Bechdel hints at a few things. Firstly, the Ourboros is a symbol of eternal cyclicity; The connection of the beginning and the end.
Snakes shed their skin and regrow.
The exile of Adam and Eve was their entry into the world.
And Alison's beginning (her coming out as lesbian) coincides with her father's end.
Note the cyclical nature of these panels Bechdel shows us: Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad...
Bechdel follows up with a second trip that she took when she was young. Lets see how this second trip complements the first!
This smooth transition supports Bechdel's cyclic theme she has going; The two points in time are connected.
Here, Bechdel recalls seeing a "truck-driving bulldyke" that she calls unsettling. 
She uses the same word here with the snake.
Furthermore, the woman's hair is almost snake-like. She embodies ambiguity.
There may even be a Medusa allusion in there, as her appearance may shock society- turn them into stone.
Alison is captivated and sustained through this vision.
But not her father. He recognizes what she stands for.
He questions Alison's intentions, and very much disapproves.
Quite hypocritical, as he dressed like a woman in his youth!
He despises that part of himself and perhaps doesn't want Alison to go through the same societal challenges that come with it.
Bechdel says the woman "haunted" her father because he was reminded of his own situation. But he had to hide homself while the woman did not.
Young Alison lies about herself like her father.
Something interesting to point out is how she calls it a "vision". It's almost like an out of world experience.
Because this takes place in urban Philidelphia, the society there would be very different from what she is used to. 
We see Allison in the car to Philidelphia...
Then getting in the car to leave. It creates a beginnning and an end, a tiny loop that just adds to the cyclic vibe. 
The motif is everywhere at this point.
