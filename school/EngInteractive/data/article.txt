There's this curious little scene in Bechdel's Fun Home where she encounters a snake while on a trip.
At first glance, the snake might appear to only keep the plot interesting.
But Bechdel has allusions and symbolisms lurking around left and right. She makes formal decisions that help convey her story.
Firstly, how does Bechdel frame her younger self's discovery of the snake?
During this trip, Alison ventures into the forest to get some cans of pop, or soda. (I'll refer to her younger self as Alison and her present self as Bechdel, the narrator).
Her walking is slow, shoulders are hunched forward, and eyes are cast down, creating a tense atmosphere.
When she sees the snake, she runs out of the forest and shouts for help.
But when Bill pulls out his gun, Alison is shocked. What did she expect?
When Bill gets there, the snake is nowhere to be found. Alison feels relieved but also embarrassed.
She also describes it as failing an initiation rite. In what way? There is reason to believe that this "rite" refers to the losing of her virginity.
Why do I jump there? On the next page, Bechdel acknowledges the use of the snake as a phallus.
Plus Bill here has quite the questionable pose... (Be creative)
Alison's experience with the snake seems to allude to her attempt at hetero-sex.
This particular snake, the Black Rat Snake, is a harmless and commonly found species in Pennsylvania.
It seems that she didn't like what she saw, hence the relief when it was gone.
But she feels that she falls short of society's expectations and feels embarrassed for being scared of something harmless.
Alison realizes at a young age what she likes and does not like. She feels embarrassed and also wonders about the implications for the future. 
Notice how only she seems to be concerned, while everyone else is unbothered. This is a problem only she is facing.
What else does the snake signify to Alison? 
Not only is the snake a phallus, but there is a feminine aspect to the snake.
